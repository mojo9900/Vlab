        <h1>Theory</h1>
        <h2>Wind Turbine</h2>
        <p>Wind Turbine is a machine used to produce electrical energy.
          It is used to convert Kinetic Energy into Electrical Energy.
          The Kinetic Energy is obtained from wind rotating the wind turbine
          which then generates electricity.
        </p>
        <h2>Sizes of Wind Turbine</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Small Wind Turbines</b> can generate upto 10 Kilowatts (KW) of
          energy. They are used to fulfill needs of a single home.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Big Wind Turbines</b> can generate upto 10 Megawatts (MW).
          They are used to fulfill needs of small towns, factories
          and power plants. Also they supply electricity to large
          electricity grids.
        </p>
        <h2>Applications of Wind Turbines</h2>
        <p>
          The Wind Turbines are used as alternate source of energy.
          We use wind power to produce electricity.
          This electricity can be used for our daily life use and for power plants.
          It is a cheaper and cost effective source of energy.
        </p>
        <h2>Types of Wind Turbines</h2>
        <h3>Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT)</h3>
        <p>
          These are the most common type of Wind Turbines.
          They consist of three blades. The blades operate in upwind
          direction. The turbine is pivoting on the top of the tower such
          that the blades face in the direction of the wind.
        </p>
        <h3>Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT)</h3>
        <p>These turbines are omnidirectional wind turbines.
          It means they operate in multi directions.
          The turbines do not point in the direction of wind to operate.
          These vertical turbines can utilize winds blowing from all
          directions. They consist blades which can rotate around a vertical
          pole. Common type of vertical axis wind turbines is
          “the Eggbeater-style Darrieus Turbine”.
        </p>
        <h2>How Wind Turbine Produces Electricity</h2>
        <p>The Wind Turbine has fan and blades. The blowing winds move the
          blades of fan. These blades of propeller of turbine turn the
          rotor. Then rotor will spin the electricity generator.
          This creates the electricity.
        </p>
        <p>The wind turbine uses aerodynamic force to convert wind energy
          nto electricity.
        </p>
        <p>This aerodynamic force is transmitted from the moving rotor
          blades. These blades are similar to helicopter or aeroplane motor
          blades. As the wind blows across the blades, the air pressure on
          one side of the blade is decreased. Due to the difference in air
          pressure across the two sides of the blade, the lift forces and
          drag forces are created.
        </p>
        <p>The Lift Force is stronger than the Drag Force. As a result,
          the rotor is spin round at fast speed. This rotor is connected to
          the generator.
        </p>
        <p>We can have direct connection, like in a direct drive turbine.
          Also, we can have shaft and series of gears connection,
          like in a gearbox turbine. They increase speed of the rotation.
          As a result, an electricity generator starts producing
          electricity.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, the transformation of aerodynamic force into rotation of
          a generator produces the electric currents or electricity.
